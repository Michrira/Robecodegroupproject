# Robecodegroupproject: FLIX & Feasts


## Description

FLIX & Feasts is a webpage that give users recommendations on food and movies when they can’t decide what they want for dinner & a movie kind of night.  After clicking a button to choose their current mood, users will be prompted with questions that will direct them toward what food they might like.  Our code will then give them a recommendation of what to watch and what food to eat.  They will be directed to the results page to see what movie and what food the app has suggested for them.  There they are able to learn more about the movie suggested with the movie poster and synopsis as well as the food suggestions.    

Our motivation for creating this app is because our project group members have been in the situation where we’ve been with a another person that just doesn’t know what they want to eat.   Our personal suggestions get shot down and we stay in square one for a long period of time before anyone decides on anything.   We know we want to watch a movie & we know we want to eat something, but sometimes we just don’t know exactly what the answer is.  FLIX & Feasts makes those decisions for indecisive users like us.  

As full-stack bootcamp students, we built this project to showcase the skills we have learned in HTML, CSS frameworks, JavaScript, JQuery, and server-side APIs.  Our app also exhibits the usage of 2 server-side APIs as well as client-side storage to store persistent data.  We also called media queries so that our interactive page could be viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.  With these skills we applied them to the creation of an app that solves a real-life problem.  

Our app, FLIX & Feasts, solves the problem of making the decision of what to eat and what to watch when all you know is you want dinner and a movie.  As a team, we commiserated with each other about how we've encountered the problem of not knowing what we want to eat and wasting time going back and forth but never really coming to a decision.  With FLIX & Feasts, it does the thinking for the user.  By choosing a mood, and answering a few randomly selected questions so the app understands what the user is feeling, food choice and movie choice is returned for a good night in.  Even if the user doesn't know how they feel, "I don't know," is also an option.  

As we created this app, we learned the importance of communication, collaboration, respect, and patience. In our group, we had a smooth sailing experience because we all embodied these things from thr start. There were many obstacles in the way but patience and collaboration allowed us to quickly and swiftly get over those obstacles. We also learned how to better read API documentation. All of our HTML, CSS, AND JavaScript skills improved tenfold.  We also learned that with the Yelp API we called for our food options, we would need daily authorization.

## Usage

When you are on the webpage for Flix & Feasts, the user will be prompted with several questions to gather information about their mood and food preferences. THe first question will be "What's your mood today?". The user is presented with 5 options and the user can click on any one of the buttons - "happy, sad, excited, angry, idk".

Once they click on their answer, three questions will pop up under the "What type of food are you feeling?" question. In the drop down bar, the user can answer "yes," "no," or "I dont know" by clicking on the button. Once those questions are answered, the user will need to click on the button "get food suggestions".

The user will be transported to a new page that will display their results and automatically show them their movie suggestions with that movie's synopsis and movie poster as well as their food suggestion.
If a user chooses a mood but does not answer the food questions, a movie and food item will still be suggested. The user must choose a mood to get a movie and food result.
